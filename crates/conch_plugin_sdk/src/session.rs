//! Session backend types for plugins that provide terminal sessions.
//!
//! A session backend is a bidirectional byte stream. The plugin provides raw
//! bytes (e.g., from an SSH channel) and the host feeds them into an
//! `alacritty_terminal::Term` via the VTE parser. The plugin never touches
//! terminal internals — it just provides I/O.
