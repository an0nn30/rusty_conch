//! Icon name constants for the built-in Conch icon set.
//!
//! Plugins reference icons by string name in widget fields like
//! `TreeNode::icon`. These constants ensure plugins use valid icon names
//! from the shared set rather than inventing their own.
//!
//! All icons are 16x16 PNGs with theme-aware variants (dark/light) where
//! applicable. The host automatically selects the correct variant.
