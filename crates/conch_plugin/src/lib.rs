//! Host-side plugin infrastructure for Conch.
//!
//! This crate provides:
//!
//! - **Message bus** (`bus`) — event broadcast (pub/sub), direct query routing
//!   (request/response), and a service registry for inter-plugin communication.
//!
//! - **Native plugin loader** (`native`) — discovers, loads, and manages native
//!   plugins (shared libraries) via `dlopen`/`libloading`. Each plugin runs on
//!   its own OS thread with a bounded thread pool.
